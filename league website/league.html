          <p>What is League of Legends?</p>
              <li>League of legends is a team based MOBA that is free to play and fun for everyone.</li>
              <li>It has been the most played PC game in North America and Europe for quite some time since 2012.</li>
              <li>The game is available on Windows, MAC, and Mobile!</li>
              <li>With updates every two weeks, the game doesn't seem to be losing popularity anytime soon.</li>
              <li>Founded by Riot Games in 2009</li>

        <section id="Maps" class="main-section">
          <header>Maps</header>
          <p>There are two main maps available to play on, those being Summoner's Rift and Howling Abyss.</p>
          <p>Summoner's Rift is a 5v5 type map that includes 3 lanes and 2 jungles to roam around, where the main objective is to eliminate the nexus of the opponent's base. This is the main map, and involves strategic plans to win.</p>
          <img src="https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/league-of-legends/2/22/New_Rift.jpg" class="image"></img>
          <p>Howling Abyss is also a 5v5 type map, but is only one lane, and no jungle. This is a fun way to play with your team, with no strategy really needed.</p>
          <p>Riot Games often releases game modes with other maps, but they are limited for their time.</p>

        <section id="Runes" class="main-section">
          <header>Runes</header>
          <p>Runes are enhancements that add abilities and buffs to the champion. The player can choose their loadout of runes before the match begins. There are 5 classes of runes, and players can select one main (with a strong keystone ability) and one subset.</p>

          <li>Precision</li>
            <p>Precision is mainly used for champions that attack a lot. Marksman and fighters can be seen running these runes a lot. 
          <li>Domination</li>
            <p>Domination is, as it says, a dominating rune. Champions that want to kill with quick bursts of damage will use these runes.</p>
          <li>Sorcery</li>
            <p>Sorcery is involved in a lot of spell casting. Mages and supports will be using sorcery runes.</p>
          <li>Resolve</li> 
            <p>Resolve is a rune tree dedicated to solid tanks. Champions that last long in fights, but deal less damage will find these runes useful.</p>
          <li>Inspiration</li>
            <p>Inspiration runes are tricky, but they are still viable. Special champions with specific playstyles can abuse inspiration runes to its best, but supports can also use them too.</p>
